Start with an empty stack and an empty circuit (eulerian path).

    - If all but 2 vertices have same out-degree as in-degree, and one of those 2 vertices has out-degree with one greater than its in-degree, and the other has in-degree with one greater than its out-degree - then choose the vertex that has its out-degree with one greater than its in-degree.
    - Otherwise no euler circuit or path exists.
If current vertex has no out-going edges (i.e. neighbors) - add it to circuit, remove the last vertex from the stack and set it as the current one. Otherwise (in case it has out-going edges, i.e. neighbors) - add the vertex to the stack, take any of its neighbors, remove the edge between that vertex and selected neighbor, and set that neighbor as the current vertex.
Repeat step 2 until the current vertex has no more out-going edges (neighbors) and the stack is empty."""
